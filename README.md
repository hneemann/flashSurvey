FlashSurvey is a simple, fast, and user-friendly survey application that 
can be used in a lecture to conduct a survey among the students present.
It is possible to create surveys with multiple choice questions.
The creator of the survey can choose whether students are allowed to give 
only one answer or select multiple options.

The creating user has to open a web-page containing a QR-Code to be shown 
on a video projector. This way the students are able to scan the shown 
QR-Code to take part in the survey. 
Neither the creator of the survey nor the students need an account.

This way, launching a survey, letting students vote, and displaying the 
results is a matter of seconds.

It is not possible to store a survey template on the server. 
But you can create a permanent URL of the survey and
use it later to create a new survey with the same questions.
This way you can store survey templates in your browser bookmarks.
