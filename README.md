FlashSurvey is a simple, fast, and easy-to-use survey application.
It is possible to create surveys with multiple choice questions, with 
up to six answers. The creating user is able to create the survey and 
open a page containing a QR-Code to be shown on a beamer. This way the 
voting users are able to scan the shown QR-Code to take part in the 
survey. It is no account required, but you have to host it on your own.

Because there is no account required, it is not possible to store a 
survey template. But you can copy a permanent URL of the survey and
use it later to create a new survey with the same questions.
This way you can store survey templates in your browser bookmarks.
